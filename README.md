Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering priciples,methods and tools to development and maintanance of high quality software.
It has enabled creation of software applications that are used in modern aspects of healthcare,communication,commerce and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Develpment of programming languages such as C
Establishment of software engineering as a principle in the 1960s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Designing- creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- writing code and building software according to design specifications
Testing- conducting of tests to ensure the software meets quality standards
Deployment- releasing software to the users
Maintenance- providing support and updates to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases while the agile methology is iterative and incremental that focuses on flexibilty and collaboration



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality assuarance engineer- designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality
Project manager- oversees planning and execution of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They enhance productivity,collaboration and code quality
IDEs- visual studio and Eclipse
VCS-Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing of requirements during the development cycle leading to project dealys- there should be effective communication
Tights deadlines- agile methodologies since its focused on flexibility and collaboration


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules
Integration- testing interactions between different components
System- testing the entire software
Acceptance-testing software against user requirements
Testing ensures identifying and fixing defects in the early stages of software development

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions in order to get the best possible responces from Ai models. It has helped enhance the interaction between humans and Ai 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-"how to bake"
Improved prompt-"how to bake a chocolate cookies in an oven, include recipe, oven temperature settings and time"
The improved prompt is specific, has separated instructions ans is complete
